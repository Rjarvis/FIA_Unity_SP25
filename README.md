This repository is a Unity-based framework designed to teach and demonstrate core principles of C#, Entity-Component-System (ECS) methodology, and modular game architecture.

This project serves both as a teaching tool and a prototype foundation, offering reusable systems that can be toggled, debugged, and scaled independently ‚Äî ideal for rapid development, experimentation, and instruction.
üîß Core Features

    üñåÔ∏è In-Editor Tools for Sprite & Level Design

        Custom Editor scripts allow users to create 2D sprite-based art directly in Unity.

        Simple level design tools with save/load functionality using Unity assets or ScriptableObjects.

    üß† Lightweight EntitySystem Framework

        Implements a custom ECS-like architecture to organize game memory and logic into Contexts, Entities, Components, and Systems.

        Systems are decoupled and context-aware, enabling easy testing, reuse, and scalability.

    ‚öôÔ∏è Modular System Execution

        Systems can be toggled on/off at runtime for performance profiling or debugging.

        Designed to support parallel development across features without introducing dependencies or monoliths.

    üì¶ Built for Extension

        Add or remove features without touching core logic.

        Ideal for building games, tools, or educational prototypes in a clean, controlled environment.

üöÄ Ideal Use Cases

    Teaching Unity programming with a focus on clean architecture.

    Prototyping ECS-style mechanics before committing to Unity DOTS or third-party frameworks.

    Creating modular games with well-separated concerns for UI, input, physics, and logic.

Built for Teaching at The Future Innovators Academy.
